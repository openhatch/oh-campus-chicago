  <h2>The Background</h2>
  <p>
    Students like you around the world are gaining valuable
    experience, connections, and skills by coding, testing, and
    writing for free software projects like Firefox, WordPress,
    Adium, and Ubuntu. We're running an event to teach about these tools
    and communities to women at universities all around Chicago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Come and learn all about sharing your own code, and
    contributing to projects that make a difference in the world!
  </p>

  <p>You do <em>not</em> need to know how to program to contribute to
    free software. You can contribute code, but also original art,
    testing, documentation, web design, or anything else. We want to
    teach you how to join them.</p>

  <h2>The events</h2>

  <p>
    Come to UIC <strong>SEO 1000</strong> on <strong>Wed 9/25</strong>
    and <strong>Thu 9/26</strong> evenings, 5pm-9pm, and we'll feed
    you, bring you up to speed on open source projects, and help you
    contribute to a real community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wed 9/25 is the <strong>tutorials day</strong>: you'll learn about
    version control, how open source projects communicate, the history
    and ethics of open source, and hear from professionals who
    contribute to open source in their day jobs in a career panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thu 9/26 is the <strong>projects day</strong>: you'll work
    hands-on with mentors to select a task in an open source project
    that you can fix and contribute a change to that community. (Maybe
    you'll even decide to keep working with them afterward!)
  </p>

  <p>
    And throughout both evenings we'll feed you, get to know you, and
    talk with you about opportunities for students in open source.
  </p>

  <h2>More about open source</h2>
  <p>Free, open source software is software that is shared freely and
    available to build upon. It is a great way to apply your skills to
    real-world projects and social causes. You can participate by writing
    or reviewing code, answering users' questions, translating the
    interface to another language, making video tutorials to help new
    users, and myriad other ways. Open source software is often produced
    by lots of people collaborating across time and space, and this event
    specially welcomes newcomers to that style of development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open source participation is one way to gain real-world skills and
    make connections that will last you through your career. Volunteer
    staff will include professionals and academics who use open source
    daily.
